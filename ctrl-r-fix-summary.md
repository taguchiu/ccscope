# CCScope Test Suite and CI Setup

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive test suite for CCScope using Jest, along with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.

## Changes Made

### Test Framework Setup

1. **Jest Configuration**
   - Added Jest as devDependency 
   - Created `jest.config.js` with proper Node.js test environment settings
   - Configured code coverage thresholds (80% overall, 70% branches)
   - Set up test file patterns and ignore patterns

2. **Test Structure**
   - Created `__tests__/` directory with organized test files
   - Added test helpers in `__tests__/helpers/`
   - Created setup file for global test configuration

### Component Tests

1. **SessionManager.test.js**
   - Tests for session discovery and parsing
   - JSONL file parsing validation
   - Search and filter functionality tests
   - Statistics generation tests

2. **StateManager.test.js** 
   - View navigation and state management tests
   - Filtering and sorting tests
   - Tool expansion state tests
   - State persistence tests

3. **ViewRenderer.test.js**
   - UI rendering tests with mocked terminal
   - Layout calculation tests
   - Theme formatting tests
   - Virtual scrolling tests

4. **InputHandler.test.js**
   - Keyboard input handling tests
   - Navigation and action tests
   - Search mode tests
   - Mouse event filtering tests

5. **MouseEventFilter.test.js**
   - Mouse event detection tests
   - Pattern matching tests
   - Scroll event extraction tests
   - Edge case handling

6. **ThemeManager.test.js**
   - Theme switching tests
   - Color formatting tests
   - Text width calculation tests
   - Cache management tests

### CI/CD Pipelines

1. **ci.yml** - Main CI workflow
   - Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
   - Multi-version Node.js testing (14.x, 16.x, 18.x, 20.x)
   - Code coverage reporting
   - Security audits
   - Package validation

2. **test-pr.yml** - Pull request testing
   - Automated test runs on PRs
   - Coverage reporting in PR comments
   - Test result summaries

3. **release.yml** - Automated releases
   - Triggered on version tags
   - Creates GitHub releases
   - Publishes to npm (when configured)

### Documentation Updates

- Added comprehensive testing section to README.md
- Included test running instructions
- Documented test structure
- Added coverage requirements
- Explained CI/CD processes

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides good coverage of core functionality:
- Unit tests for all major components
- Mock implementations for terminal I/O
- Edge case handling
- Error condition testing

## Future Improvements

1. Add integration tests for full user workflows
2. Add performance benchmarking tests
3. Improve test coverage to reach 90%+
4. Add visual regression tests for terminal output
5. Add E2E tests with actual transcript files

## Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```
